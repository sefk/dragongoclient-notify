Notification Server for the DragonGoClient
=====================

Notification server for the Justin Weiss's Dragon Go Client.
DGSClient is a nice native iPhone app for playing Go on the [Dragon
Go Server][dgs].  This little server enables notifications using
Apple's push notification service by processing emails.
